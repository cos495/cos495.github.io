Organization of synaptic connectivity as the basis of neural
computation and learning. Perceptrons, convolutional nets, and
recurrent nets. Backpropagation and Hebbian learning. Engineering
applications including computer vision and natural language
processing.

### Requirements
  - Two 80 minute lectures and one precept per week.  
  - Grades (A-F) will be based on class participation (5%), problem sets (25%), midterm (30%), and final exam (40%).
  - Participation includes speaking up in lecture and precept.
  - Participation also includes activity on Piazza---ideally asking good questions, giving good answers, and upvoting others' contributions.

### Prerequisites
  - Familiarity with linear algebra.
  - Basics of optimization and probability theory.
  - Knowledge of Julia or Python (or willingness to learn).

### Lectures
Prof. Sebastian Seung will lecture twice a week.

- MW 3-4:20pm [McCosh Hall][mccosh-hall] 28

### Precepts
Alex Beatson, Donghun Lee, Qipeng Liu, and Ari Seff will lead the weekly precepts.

- W	7:30-8:20 pm [Friend Center][friend-center]	112	by Donghun Lee

### Office Hours
The TAs each have a weekly office hour. You can visit the office hours of any TA, not just your preceptor. However, it might be particularly useful to visit your preceptor's office hours so they know what to focus on in precept.

- Th 	8:30-9:20 pm [Friend Center][friend-center]   	112  	by Qipeng Liu
- W	6:30-7:20 pm [Computer Science][computer-science]   	418a  	by Ari Seff
- W	8:30-9:20 pm [Friend Center][friend-center]	112	by Donghun Lee

### Online discussions
You can ask and answer questions on the [Piazza site](https://piazza.com/princeton/spring2017/cos495/home).  Piazza activity counts as class participation and can enhance your grade.

### Homework assignments
Homework assignments will be due on Mondays, and should be submitted at the [Blackboard site](https://blackboard.princeton.edu/webapps/blackboard/execute/announcement?method=search&context=course&course_id=_3632370_1&handle=cp_announcements&mode=cpview).  The programming component should be submitted as a Jupyter notebook, either Julia or Python. Please submit (i) the Python or Julia notebook file, and (ii) a HTML export of the notebook clearly showing all answers and plots/visualizations.
