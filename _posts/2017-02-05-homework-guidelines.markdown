- All homework assignments are due on Mondays (see [schedule](http://cos495.github.io/schedule/)), and should be submitted through Blackboard.  

- Programming exercises should be submitted as a Jupyter notebook.  Please submit (i) the notebook itself, and (ii) a .html export of the notebook, with all cells executed in order, and **all required plots and answers clearly visible**. (To run all cells in order and export: click Kernel -> Restart & Run All, and then File -> Download As -> HTML).

- Theoretical exercises should be submitted as a PDF.  Scans of handwriting are acceptable.

- You may collaborate with others when solving the problems, but your writeup should be your own work.

- Please list the names of your collaborators (if any) on your submission.

- Explain your work as concisely as possible. You may be graded on clarity of explanation, as well as “correctness.”

- When you draw graphs, make them as informative as possible by labeling the axes and by annotating important locations.
