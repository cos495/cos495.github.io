Python notebooks for the first assignment are live on the [github repo](https://github.com/cos495/code).

If you're using Python, then to make sure your code runs as you expect on our set-ups, please:

- use Python 2.7

- don't use packages which aren't installed with Anaconda by default, except if we specify

The easiest way to install Python and the Jupyter/iPython notebook is via Anaconda. See "Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda" [here](http://jupyter.org/install.html), and make sure to install the Python 2.7 version.

If you run into issues setting it up (& can't solve them with a quick google), you can ask your TA, or just use Julia instead on juliabox.com.

Good luck with the first assignment - make sure to look at it before precept!
