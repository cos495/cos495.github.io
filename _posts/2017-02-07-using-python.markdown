If using Python, please use Python 2.7 to make sure your code runs as you expect on the TAs' set-ups.

The easiest way to install Python and the Jupyter/iPython notebook is via Anaconda. See "Installing Jupyter using Anaconda and conda" [here](http://jupyter.org/install.html), and make sure to install the Python 2.7 version.

Please don't use packages other than those installed with Anaconda by default, except when we specify (e.g. TensorFlow).

If you run into issues setting it up (& can't solve them with a quick google), you can ask your TA, or just use Julia instead on juliabox.com.

Good luck with the first assignment - make sure to look at it before precept!
