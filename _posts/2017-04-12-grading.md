This is the distribution of exam scores, based on the 69 undergraduates in the class:

We also computed scaled grades based on the midterm and psets 1-4, using the formula:
scaled_grade = 100 * ((mean_pset/70 * 0.125) + (midterm/100 * 0.30)) / (0.125 + 0.30)

This is the distribution of scaled grades for undergraduates:

If we were to assign letter grades right now, the minimum scaled grade required for A, B and C would roughly follow:
55 C
70 B
85+ A

The median score (69 for the midterm, 75 for the scaled grade) would be just above the cutoff for B+.

This should serve as a rough guide to how you're doing so far. We can't guarantee any particular distribution of final grades: the final median could be higher or lower than B+, and the percent score required for a given letter grade might increase or decrease depending on how the class does on the remainder of assessment.
