Just in time for your midterm exam preparations: here is the site with fun [animations](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic) of convolution, strided convolution, and transposed strided convolution (also known as "deconvolution"). The animations also illustrate no/half/full padding, known in MATLAB-land as the "valid", "same", and "full" options for the `conv` function. 
You can also download the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1603.07285) that accompanies the animations.
