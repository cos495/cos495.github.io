Some of you looked shell-shocked after yesterday's barrage of indices.  I added some more slides to `backprop.pptx` (jump to slide titled "High-level view"), which contain another attempt to explain the derivation of backprop from the gradient learning principle.  The updated slide deck is in the same [Google Drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0BwWWE4p0wihlcDBfcEMxeDhVWk0).  This is standard material, so you can also read about it in many textbooks. For example, you can try Nielsen's [online book](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html).
