The class enrollment is currently maxed out at 85, a limit set by the number of TAs.  If you want to join the class, you can wait for other students to drop out and try to register for the newly free spots. There is a slim chance that I will be able to secure an additional TA, in which case the enrollment cap would be increased.  (The COS department has been unable to find more TAs for the class.)
