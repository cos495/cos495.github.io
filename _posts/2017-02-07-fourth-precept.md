Good news! Donghun Lee will teach a fourth precept. If you have preferences regarding the time, please post them in Piazza.

We are now planning to raise the enrollment cap to 100. Unfortunately no one has been able to register yet because the relevant COS Dept. administrator was out of the office today.  I think she'll be back tomorrow or the day after, and will request the appropriate changes from the registrar.
